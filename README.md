# babel

A proof of concept tool for transforming error message in Clojure into beginner friendly forms.
Very early in development.
Paper describing its use and development availible [here](https://github.com/Clojure-Intro-Course/mics2018demo/blob/master/mics2018.pdf "MICS Paper")

## Usage

Copy ``babel`` and ``errors`` into your src directory, and then make sure your ``project.clj`` has compatible version of all packages used in our ``project.clj``. Be sure to include the ``:nrepl-middleware`` keys.
